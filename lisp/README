Lisp startup of the server will not work in any operation system
and may not work without modification with any LISP implementation.
Even though this script does work in some operating systems, it
does not work on Mac.

For any operating system using SBCL LIPS, the following should work:

/path/to/sbcl --script startup_holiday.lisp

This will start the script directly instead of passing it through a
standard interpreter that will have to read the file first before passing
it to sbcl.

All functions tested with SBCL 1.5.5.
