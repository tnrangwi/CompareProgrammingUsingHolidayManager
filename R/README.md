Limitations
===========

Apart from examples in different languages the R version needs installation of
packages. I haven't found a way to use namespaces in R without building *and*
installing the package. I was quite surprised that the namespace / package
or even module concept (as it is there in Python, Perl, Lisp, Haskell) does
not work with R without installing a package.

The packages can be installed locally without special rights, a script follows.
